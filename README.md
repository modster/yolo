# yolo
YoloBot is a NodeJS server that parses incoming TradingView.com alerts and responds by placing buy or sell orders on the exchange(s) of your choosing. Alerts can be plain text or JSON. YoloBot ships with three basic functions (buy, sell, stop), and only supports the Binance exchange. It is easily modified to suit your purpose.
